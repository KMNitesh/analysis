## Function enhance to Tinker 7 ( A molecular dynamic simulation package)

- add discrete charge transfer term to AMOEBA polarizable force field
- add binary trajectory format (NetCDF,from Amber) support in molecular dynamics and post-analysis program
- addtional trajectory analysis based on C++, includes

1.   trajectory format conversion between Tinker ARC, Gromacs Trr, Gromacs Xtc, Gromacs Gro and Amber Netcdf
2.   Diffusion coefficient based on Einstein and Green-Kubo equation
3.   Hydrogen bond analysis
4.   Rotational autocorrelation function
5.   NMR NOE calculation
6.   Water residence time
7.   Cluster analysis based on linkage method
